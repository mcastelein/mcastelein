## Hi there, I'm Michael 😁

I'm a Dutch-American data scientist and engineer with a background in econometrics, mathematics, and aerospace engineering. I love building clean, useful, and data-driven tools — especially when they combine automation, analytics, and a touch of creativity.

### Project Portfolio
1. NYC STAR Voting Analysis
- 🗳️ Contributed to Equal Vote's [rcv-analysis](https://github.com/Equal-Vote/rcv-analysis) repo
- 🔍 Built a Python tool to process ranked-choice data from the 2021 NYC Mayoral election for STAR voting simulation
- 💻 Tools: Python, Pandas, Git
2. Chinese Learning App
- Podcast and Streamlit App (in the future to be a mobile app)
- Learn more chinese vocab, with only audio
- Tools: Python, Streamlit
- Instructions to download and run it [here](https://github.com/mcastelein/I-CAN-Chinese/tree/main)
3. Exercise Accountability Dashboard
- I run a series of exercise accountability groups
- For those, I track progress and balances via a streamlit dashboard
- Check it out [here](https://exercise-accountability-dashboard.streamlit.app/)
- And here is the [github repo](https://github.com/mcastelein/AccountabilityDashboard) for it
4. [My Masters Thesis](https://github.com/mcastelein/Masters-Thesis/tree/main): Energy Prices Prediction comparison of Machine Learning models with Spacial Econometircs
- Compared Linear Regression, SARIMAX, Random Forest, GRU, LSTM
- Ran each model with an without a spatial lag
- More information in linked repo
5. **Kaggle Projects**
- [Iris Data Classification Github Repo](https://github.com/mcastelein/Iris-Species-Classification/tree/main) & [Streamlit Dashboard](https://michael-castelein-iris-species-classification.streamlit.app/) - Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines
